(26, 71, 'My alters and I', 'I don&rsquo;t understand why I can&rsquo;t be me! A minimum of two personalities seem to live within me. Each serving their duty at a certain time in my life but they seem to ignore metamorphosis and cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe insecure boyish selfâ€Š&mdash;â€Š&ldquo;Pam&rdquo;- caused and still causes me the most trouble. She questions everyones intentions, sincerity and judgement. Judgement in the existence of her or her value. Intentions are always negative, selfish and destructive. Sincerity was so rare that Pam never understood its real purpose. She fought for attention which she associates with meaningfulness. Not learning the means to form healthy, organic and balanced friendships. One who doesn&rsquo;t see his/her own value makes it hard for others to love them. Happiness seems to be a disease that need to be cured with manipulation.\r\n\r\n No matter how much appreciation she receives, she downplays the importance. She is loud and can&rsquo;t be by herself . Over acting, bragging, lost of self-control are her means to case the skewed dream of belongingâ€Š&mdash;â€Šunachievable with these ways.\r\n\r\nThere is the powerhouseâ€Š&mdash;â€Š&ldquo;L&rdquo;â€Š&mdash;â€Šwho flourishes in a challenging and creative environment. She has no actual goal she wants to achieve in her career. The journey and it&rsquo;s sacrifices define her purpose in life. Being at her best when she can rebel agains something or someone. Challenging herself to prove to be capable of mastering or outdoing the opponent. Her wars are never personal but with herself. Deep within herself, she wants to be loved and find her place in society. She rarely allows her vulnerable side to surface and is surprised that when she does, her surrounding is confused and surprised. The only currency she accepts is success, knowledge and confidence. Alienating, distancing herself and dominating situations and others. In the next moment however downplaying herself to fit in. She knows of her capabilities, fortunes and value which she doesn&rsquo;t praise modestly in moments of alcohol or drug induced states of mind. Sober she is ashamed of this arrogance and plays down her assets. She is confident, smart and hardworking but has no healthy relationship to these assets. \r\n\r\nA networker par excellence\r\nThe least valued by herself yet beloved by others isâ€Š&mdash;â€Š&ldquo;Mother&rdquo;- the always caring, helpful and warm personality. She is there when needed and gives her all to support and care for others. Others wellbeing is her main priority. Going out of her way to create a comfortable atmosphere. Providing a home to who ever needs one. Being selfless to an unhealthy extend, always caring more about others then herself. She believes that only when one gives everything that one can experience happiness. Being that caring drowns all her energy or she is overwhelmed by the responsibility she took on. That is when she disappears to recharge and protect herself. This personality is very inconsistent and most vulnerable to being overpowered by Pat or L. Self-perception is dominated by weakness in showing emotions and opening the heart.\r\n\r\nThe most playful personality is -&rdquo;Lenny&rdquo;- a cheeky, playful and charming side that mostly blossoms with the presence of children. He simplifies the world and acts on intuition. Only the present moment is what matters. Wealth, possessions and tactics are unknown to him. The heart guides the way and the gut decides the direction. Free spirited, he forgets the world around him and is with himself. He flirts without understanding the purpose or potential consequences for an adult. Hugging, kissing and attention are ways to discover the world, show interest and form a bond. Without them there is emptiness in his world and all his love seems lost. The adult reality with its rules is ignored in order to stay in the moment. He hopes that his understanding of forming a bond is universally shared but fails therewith in the adult world. Therefore he is confronted with situations that he can&rsquo;t comprehend. He goes along, believing in the good. What happens then is often erased from his memory in order to have to hand over to another personality. In the worst case an other personalityâ€Š&mdash;â€Šlike L - has to intervene, scolds Lenny and banishes him. Leaving behind sadness, emptiness and shame.\r\nThey are all part of me. I need to start to value them instead of playing them out against each other.\r\n\r\nLenny allows me to live in the now. Treasuring moments, interactions and displaying unconditional affection. He is my cheeky, playful and innocent side.\r\nMother balances all my personalities and enforces empathy, understanding and thoughtfulness. She needs to find an equilibrium of caring without giving up oneself. Her strength will stabilize me and help grow a healthy self-esteem and relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nL needs to work out my true capabilities and preferences. They need then to be strengthened, affirmed and embedded in my personality. Accepting help, enforcing empathy and healthy confidence are her main challanges, but she can count on Mother for support.\r\n\r\n\r\nPam needs to talk more to L and Mother. Growing to like myself in all aspects is her task. Letting go of old beliefs will take time but is something she is equipped to do. When Lenny puts himself in danger she has to be the big sister and step in to protect him. Transforming her self-destructive energy in a positive asset that is valued and needed.

(30, 71, 'OCD and Meâ€Šâ€”â€ŠThe Story So Far', 'I am not officially diagnosed with OCD but I am pretty confident I have it after talking to people who have it and doing research. It is a serious mental illness. It is different for everybody. When somebody says that they &ldquo;are so OCD&rdquo;, they are misunderstanding what it is. They usually say that after they do full cleaning or organizing session. That isn&rsquo;t OCD. That is just being clean. They don&rsquo;t realize that OCD has a variety of symptoms.\r\n\r\nMy OCD is more of obsessing than acting on my impulses. Mine is more of thinking. This means that when I see something, I analyze every bit of it. I have to do certain things to satisfy my mind. My OCD started after a bad car accident in 6th grade. I believe this the event that triggered my OCD into full swing.\r\nThe main symptom of my OCD is patterns. You know how on shows with geniuses, they show their point of view with diagrams and equations? That&rsquo;s sort of what it&rsquo;s like for me. If you look at 5 dots, you see 5 dots. If I look at 5 dots, I see a pattern. My patterns are usually skipping items. I will go to the 1st dot, 3rd dot and 5th dot and will be satisfied. If there is an even number of dots, it won&rsquo;t satisfy me. I will find ways to arrange the dots or objects to be odd. If I can&rsquo;t, it will bother me and I will keep going over it again and again because I am obsessed that there is no solution. This also stems into my obsession over odd numbers. I know that odd numbers result in being satisfied.\r\n\r\nThis is the best way I can show the way I see 5 dots. My mind tells me to choose the odd numbers.\r\nAnother symptom of my OCD that is bothersome is checking for signs of illness. This symptom came after my type 1 diabetes diagnosis. I think this came because I missed my symptoms for so long that it almost sent me into a coma, and I don&rsquo;t want to miss another diagnosis that could kill me. For example, if you get a sniffle and runny nose, you see a cold and treat it like nothing. If I get the same symptoms, my mind starts thinking that it could be pneumonia or another serious illness. If I&rsquo;m sick, I check my lymph nodes when I wake up. I check to make sure I don&rsquo;t have rashes. I check my ketones to make sure my kidneys aren&rsquo;t poisoning me from diabetes. You are supposed to check your ketones when you are vomiting. It&rsquo;s like a switch in my mind that I can&rsquo;t turn off. I recently got a Fitbit Blaze so I don&rsquo;t have to check my pulse constantly and make sure my heart is beating right.\r\n\r\nThe scariest symptom I have is when I drop something. If you drop a paper or something, you might pick it up, you might not. If I drop something and contemplate leaving it, my mind starts to think about all the bad things that could happen. If I accidentally drop a pen, I will think about leaving it. When I have that thought, my mind goes to another place. It thinks that my dog will get the pen and eat it and ingest the ink, causing her to die. It sounds drastic, but that&rsquo;s what my mind thinks. I can&rsquo;t stop my mind from wandering there. After that thought, I will pick up the pen.\r\n\r\nOne of the more recent symptoms that developed is making sure the doors are locked. It may seem like an everyday thing, but to me, it is checking 2 or 3 times to make sure it is locked. I have 3 doors to lock. I will lock them 1 time. I will go back around all 3 doors to make sure they are all locked. My mind tells me that if the door isn&rsquo;t locked, somebody will come into the house and hide out and hurt me and my family. Again, drastic but my mind is powerful.\r\nAs you can see, I have a lot of things to deal with on a daily basis. OCD causes me to lose sleep. I will look for patterns in my room. I will keep recalling whether or not I locked the doors before I went to bed. If I am unable to find patterns or I try to fight my symptoms, I get anxiety. I get anxiety going to doctor appointments because I am afraid they will find something serious that I missed and it can&rsquo;t be treated. I always carry a pen with me because when my anxiety gets up, I have to fidget and do something with my hands. I will take my pen and start clicking it. If it doesn&rsquo;t click, I will keep removing and replacing the cap. I bite the end of my pen caps.\r\n\r\nOCD is a serious illness. It causes people to stay in their homes and not leave. It causes people to scrub their hands raw. It causes my mind to never quiet down. My mind races at a pace of 1,000 miles an hour. I will eventually seek out a therapists help. I have a support system from my family and friends. They support me through everything. Until I seek out a therapists help, my friends and family are helping me cope.', '2017-03-03 06:55:45', 0.59736276090053, 0, 0, 18, 1),
(31, 71, 'Have you ever thought about Suicide?', 'Back in December of 2004 - doesn&#039;t seem real it&#039;s been almost ten years, I was living in Portland Oregon attending college. I was sitting at home one night, writing my last research paper for the term. I had my Yahoo IM up, chatting to a few friends when a message from someone NOT on my list pops up. &quot;Have you ever thought about suicide?&quot;\r\n\r\nUh, ok - weird, but hey it&#039;s almost midnight on a Sunday night and stranger things have been asked to me before &quot;Can I see your tits?&quot; etc. So I message the stranger back for kicks, &quot;Sure who hasn&#039;t at some point why?&quot;\r\nWell asking that question opened pandora&#039;s box - he battered me with questions about how I wanted to die, why did I want to die, would I want to die with others etc. Obviously, getting creepier and creepier as the conversation continues. But I play along, assuming the guy is just screwing around with me. I ask him his name, he say&#039;s it&#039;s Jerry and I ask to see a picture. He sends me to a profile pic on Hot or Not and asks me if I think he&#039;s good looking. I tell him sure, yeah your cute whatever.\r\n\r\nHe asks to see a picture of me - I send him a random old photo of a girl on my myspace friends (yes it&#039;s that old, I realize now). And he tells me he thinks I&quot;m a 10. Awesome - thanks Jerry, who is obsessed with suicide. As the conversation continues he tells me he&#039;s sick of life and women don&#039;t seem to be attracted to him, so he wants to end it all. I tell him the things you&#039;re supposed to say to people in this situation - relationships are nothing, you&#039;re more important to the people in your life - don&#039;t do it, blah blah blah - I&#039;m not heartless, but I just don&#039;t feel like talking someone off of a ledge at now, 1am.\r\n\r\nJerry tells me he&#039;s met a lot of women online that want to kill themselves, and that he&#039;s planning a party for Valentine&#039;s Day (1.5 months from now) so everyone can come and do it together at his house in Klamath Falls Oregon. He asks me if I&#039;m interested in joining. I say, yeah sure but make an excuse that I don&#039;t have a car to get down there for it. He tells me there are a few women from Portland coming down for it, and one of them has a van, he&#039;s sure I can catch a ride. He say&#039;s he&#039;s built a beam in his home that will hold up to fifty bodies at once, but that I shouldn&#039;t wear shoes because they&#039;ll weigh me down.\r\n\r\nBy now, yes I&quot;m starting to realize this guy is acting very serious - and this is in fact NOT a joke. So I start asking him specifics, what his address is, what his full name is, who are the women traveling from Portland. He tells me their names, and that one of them is bringing her five children with her - and that they want to die as well.\r\n\r\nHUGE RED FLAGS are up at this point. So while I&quot;m still chatting with him, I call a friend of mine back home in Eastern Oregon who works as a 911 dispatcher. She&#039;s actually at work when I call her and after telling her the whole story, she advises me to hang up and call Portland Police Department right away - at least give them the info to pass to Klamath Falls. She makes a record in their system that I&#039;ve called just in case.\r\nI keep talking to Jerry and call the Portland Police - they send 2 officers out about an hour later and they pretty much laugh at me when I explain to them what&#039;s going on. I print out our chat log, give them the guys full name and address I&#039;ve already verified through google as being legit - (as far as google can) and they tell me to just quit talking to him. Simple as that and go about their business.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t I feel stupid now? I call my friend back home and tell her what Portland PD did and she said to keep an eye on things, if he keeps talking just keep saving the conversation. So I do. For another two hours - and things just get to the point where I can&#039;t handle him anymore. He&#039;s battering me with questions about how do I want to die, wearing clothes or naked? Do I want to have sex before I die? Would I have a problem killing kids before? Would I want to hold hands with others while we hang? Finally I just told him I&#039;d be in touch closer to Valentine&#039;s Day.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, I laughed it off with some friends - because Portland PD never got back to me about anything, so of course I assumed it ended up being a very strange prank.\r\n\r\nFast Forward - February 10th 2005 a friend of mine calls me while I&#039;m on campus on my way to work, and tells me some guy down in Klamath Falls has been arrested for trying to set up a mass suicide pact for Valentine&#039;s Day. I&#039;m floored - I run to my office, log into a computer and sure enough it&#039;s everywhere on all news forums. Gerald Krien arrested for plotting Mass Suicide Valentine&#039;s Day Party.\r\n\r\nMy friend from back home see&#039;s the news and calls me, tells me I need to call back to the Portland PD and tell them I called this in back in December. I make the call, and an hour later two FBI agents are coming to pick me up at my job, taking me home and taking my entire computer to be analyzed. We sit in my living room and I&#039;m questioned over and over about my involvement and if I was really planning to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nI kept telling them over and over that I just talked to the guy as a joke - thought it was some sort of prank and that I only called the cops when he started talking about some woman from Portland bringing her kids too - and I&#039;d given all the info to the Portland PD officer&#039;s back in December, how was I supposed to know they never did anything with it? Which they didn&#039;t - they sat on it - probably shredded it, and never even sent any of the info to Klamath Falls.\r\nThe agents tell me the story has gotten a lot bigger and that Krien had contacted hundreds of people, at least thirty had agreed to come on Valentine&#039;s Day to his house and commit suicide together. One woman, her parents found some emails between she and Krien and called the police; that&#039;s how they finally got involved - not from me nearly two months ago, this happened less than week before Valentine&#039;s Day.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m freaked out, they drop me back off at the college and I tell my boss everything that&#039;s happened. She tells me that reporters have been calling non-stop since I left wanting to talk to me - she said she didn&#039;t give them my cell phone number, but that she thought it was only a matter of time before they showed up at the office. I was a student worker, my name is on the campus website/directory etc - if the AP got a hold of a police report, there was no saying how fast they could start tracking me down.\r\nI call my mom, tell her what&#039;s happened - she tells me she&#039;ll be up that evening to come get me and bring me home for a break. I take four days off , turn in what assignments I have left - the FBI has the rest on my tower and head off to Eastern Oregon to wait out the media.\r\n\r\nBIG mistake - HUGE. Because by the time I made it back home that night they&#039;d already tracked down my brother, and my sister in law thought it was so cool that ABC and CNN wanted to talk to me she gave them my parents address and my cell phone number - she&#039;s an idiot.\r\n\r\nI was harassed, chased down and semi-terrorized until I FINALLY gave an interview to Good Morning America. I hoped it would die down then, the story was out - WHO CARES. Wrong - WRONG! Apparently every freakin&#039; out let cares until you give them the 15 seconds of conversation the others didn&#039;t get.\r\nI had my 15 seconds of fame, and I never want to deal with that shit again - Krien is still sitting in the Salem state hospital for his crimes of solicitation to commit murder.\r\n\r\nMr. Have you ever thought of Suicide?

He was physically and verbally abusive to me, as well as addicted to crack. When I was trying to sleep at night, he would steal my money for crack and bring strangers into the house late at night to do drugs. They would punch holes in the wall and yell for most of the night. I was very young then, and was scared all time time of making him angry/ felt like I wasn&#039;t able to leave that relationship. Eventually I did, but I got right into another abusive relationship. During that relationship, my boyfriends brother was raping me. Both of these situations set me up for falling into a position of forced prostitution- I was seeing a therapist for awhile who referred to what happened to me as &quot;sex trafficking&quot;. I was 19 years old. Needless to say, during that time, terrible things happened to me- I was drugged so severely once that I thought I was going to die.\r\nSince then, I was able to escape (read: flee) from that situation. I was extremely lucky and even received some help from my family. I&#039;ve been able to get myself through college and am even planning to apply for a graduate program in the medical/psych field.\r\n\r\nBecause of what I&#039;ve been through, I have pretty severe PTSD.

As a result, they say well-meaning things like &ldquo;Cheer up&rdquo;, &ldquo;Things will get better&rdquo;, &ldquo;There are a lot of people worse off than you so you should be thankful&rdquo;, &ldquo;Snap out of it&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Just get over it, will you?&rdquo;), &ldquo;Stop whining&rdquo;, &ldquo;You should volunteer or do something for others so you can see how lucky you are.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh well, s&amp;$t happens to all of us&rdquo;. Yes, I have heard all these comments at one time or another. The problem is when you are depressed, you do not think logically and therefore, any platitudes or &ldquo;logical&rdquo; statements will feel ignorant, unkind or unhelpful and will usually make you feel frustrated, weird, selfish or guilty, which results in feeling even more depressed. In order to avoid hearing these well-meaning comments, a depressed person will usually prefer to not interact with anyone.\r\n\r\nTwo, misery does not love company. Depressed people know they are a downer and feel guilty about it. They feel like a loser and they know that no one wants to be around a downer or a loser so they distance themselves until such time as they are happier. Oftentimes, though, they won&rsquo;t have to distance themselves as their &ldquo;friends&rdquo; or family members do it for them.\r\n\r\nThree, a person who has been depressed for a long time, especially if they have co-morbid issues like ADHD, Asperger&rsquo;s, OCD, etc., has had to endure betrayals, scorn, harsh criticisms, teasing, bullying and unkind comments for a long, long time. Because of this, the person has learned that most people are not nice, kind or good and thus, it is better to avoid and not trust most people.\r\n\r\nIf you have someone close to you that is depressed and pushing you away, you should let them know you are there to listen (but not judge) and help support them in any way you can. You shouldn&rsquo;t try to make them &ldquo;feel better&rdquo; (because you probably can&rsquo;t). You should call them to ask how they are doing but don&rsquo;t push them to talk if they don&rsquo;t want to. You can invite them to hang out (but not with too many other people, especially strangers) but don&rsquo;t be hurt or insulted if they refuse. If you are concerned they will harm themselves, you may need to talk to their parents, siblings, therapist, etc., if possible.\r\n\r\nBeing depressed sucks for everyone&hellip;the depressed person and the people around them. Just because a depressed person pushes you away doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t love you or value your friendship and care. They just loathe themselves and don&rsquo;t want to be a burden on you or anyone else.

(43, 51, 'How it feels to attempt suicide', 'It felt sad. That after 38 years, this is all my life had become. A misery I could no longer stand to be in.\r\n\r\nI had been suicidal since I was fourteen years old, because of something that happened to me (at my father&#039;s hands). Since then I had behaved in a manner that indicated a real lack of care regarding my own survival. \r\n\r\nI joined the Marines, and volunteered for dangerous things, drove too fast, got involved in things that might get me killed, and on and on. I just didn&#039;t care about being alive.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, the one constant companion to my life was the idea, &quot;if things get too bad, I&#039;ll just kill myself&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis constant daily thought consumed everything I did, and also allowed me to be reckless and carefree about far too many things. The idea that I had a free pass to behave in anyway I chose to, led me to harm a lot of good people.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t love myself and couldn&#039;t understand why anyone else could. I always assumed that there was some other motive behind their affections. I went out of my way to destroy every relationship I ever had. \r\n\r\nOnce my third wife and I separated , I really had nothing to lose anymore. She had been the first woman I had decided to stay in love with, and things went south anyway. I gave up. On everything.\r\n\r\nI committed a bunch of &quot;white collar&quot; crimes, stole a lot of money from some local banks, and hit the road. I had 19 warrants by the time I was done with life.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I really had nothing left to lose, and in my mind something to gain from suicide. I would at least be spared spending the rest of my life in a prison cell. Which is where I was headed if I got caught.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of my death, I purchased 22 Xanax ladders, and a fifth of Jose Cuervo. I lived on Sanibel Island, about a half mile from the beach. I drove out to the beach, took my Glock .40 caliber semi-automatic, the Xanax, and the tequila, and went for a walk.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the sand, and had a talk with a god I didn&#039;t believe in, I remember saying, &quot;God if you exist, and you love me, you&#039;ll save me&quot;. I didn&#039;t see how anything could stop me at this point. I was on a deserted beach at 3 AM, the draw bridge had just gone up, so no ambulance was coming to save me, even if I was found.\r\n\r\nI swallowed the Xanax, and drank as much of the tequila as I could, in a hurry. I carried it with me as I walked out into the water. When I got about waist deep, I drank some more, built up some courage and put the gun to my head. My idea was, I will shoot myself and die, but I have heard so many stories about people messing this part up, so I took out insurance. Even if I messed up the gun part, I would drown in the water. If that didn&#039;t do it, I knew the tequila-xanax cocktail would surely finish me off.\r\n\r\nI passed out before the gun went off. \r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to me, a Sanibel K-9 officer was walking his dog on the beach that evening. He later told me at the hospital that his dog never raises any hell at night, and usually just sleeps through the evening. This night was different. The dog would not stop barking to be let out, and when he let him out, the dog went to the gate and began barking again. He reluctantly put on some shorts and a shirt and took him for a walk on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe dog spotted me as I fell into the water. Once the dog took off after me, about 300&#039; from his recollection, he noticed something in the water too. The dog got to me first, and then the officer. They pulled me out of the water, and by now I had already drowned. He radioed for assistance, and began CPR.\r\n\r\nI woke up three days later from a coma, and I was bewildered to say the least. I was alive in spite of my best efforts. \r\n\r\nI am glad I was saved. I consider it a miracle, but you can chalk it up to an excellent first response infrastructure if you like.\r\n\r\nI am no longer suicidal, and even though I spent seven years in prison for my crimes, I have more going for me now than I have ever had in the past. I have learned that life is an experience and there is nothing better than experiencing life. With all of its tragedy, joy, and enlightenment. There is more to life than we can ever fit in a sentence, paragraph, or even a library.\r\n\r\nI love being alive.', '2017-03-03 06:55:45', 0.60262591879527, 0, 0, 20, 1),

(46, 64, 'What has helped my anxiety', 'I&rsquo;m not a doctor. Simply compiling everything that&rsquo;s been helpful for my anxiety and wish someone had told me this information years ago. I&rsquo;ve posted this on a few other threads but wanted as many people to see it as possible. Apologizing in advance for formatting and length. But please give it a go. Some of the information could be really helpful!\r\n\r\nBackground: Got diagnosed with GAD and OCD a while back and have been dealing with anxiety as far back as I can remember. Was on 10mg of Lexapro once a day for a year and a half. While it helped me get through some really tough life shit, the withdrawal, in my opinion, was not worth it. However, this isn&rsquo;t the case for everyone so do what feels right for you! Anyways, here&rsquo;s the meat:\r\n\r\n1) Diet -Cutting out processed sugars and starches has made a huge difference. I&#039;ve noticed that when I consume said foods, my anxiety &quot;brain fog&quot; and depersonalization/derealization gets significantly worse. However, starches can be hard to give up completely. As a fellow carbosaurus, I understand the struggle. I found that replacing white bread with wheat bread has really helped. Wheat pasta is a good substitute too, and there isn&rsquo;t (in my opinion) a huge taste difference. Also, brown rice instead of white rice. White rice has a high glycemic index and can spike your blood sugar, which leads me to my next point --&gt;\r\n\r\n-Low blood sugar can play a huge part in anxiety. Snacking on protein rich foods every few hours can help this. I carry around a bag of bulk cashews to snack on in case I can&rsquo;t access other food. Most grocery stores now offer those one-serving packets of peanut butter and almond butter, which are so convenient to carry around with you. Slim enough for a pocket even!\r\n\r\n-Speaking of sugar, even artificial sweeteners (Sucralose, Saccharin, etc.) have been shown to heighten anxiety. These can be found in diet sodas, low fat foods, gum, and even dairy items to name a few. Honey or agave nectar can be good substitutes. BONUS: Consuming local honey exposes you to allergens in your area, which can help with allergies!\r\n\r\n-Eliminating all beverages except water. Caffeinated and/or sugary drinks are basically the devil when it comes to anxiety so I&#039;d cut back on those if it&#039;s hard to eliminate all together.\r\n\r\n-Alcohol and other drugs can cause anxiety to soar. I&#039;ve noticed after a night of drinking my depression and anxiety sky rockets.\r\n\r\n-Daily Omega. I take two Omega 3-6-9 blend fish oil pills every day and can notice a difference if I don&#039;t take them for a week.\r\n\r\n-Magnesium glycinate supplements have been said to work for a lot of people. Be careful though because certain magnesium supplements can cause explosive diarrheaðŸ’©\r\n\r\n-There&rsquo;s still debate on this one but salt. Apparently in the refining process of table salt, it gets stripped of minerals and trace elements. Pink Himalayan crystal salt contains 84 minerals and trace elements. Some people even add a tiny sprinkle to their water bottle every day. If you want to try this, be careful not to overdo it as salt can cause uncomfortable bloating.\r\n\r\n2) Meditation CAN&#039;T SAY THIS ENOUGH\r\n\r\n-No exaggeration, this in combination with a fixed diet has been my savior. I feel so good I can&#039;t go back to living without meditation.\r\n\r\n-You don&#039;t have to be a guru hippy Mother Earth child to benefit from meditation or even learn how to meditate. There is an app called Headspace that provides excellent guided meditation highly recommended\r\n\r\n-Another user told me about an app called Breathe. From what I&#039;ve read it&#039;s provided people with relief and is a great meditation tool. I&rsquo;d recommend looking into both Headspace and Breathe, as people will always have a preference.\r\n\r\n-Guided meditations are great but it&#039;s important to know how to meditate in silence as well (you won&#039;t always have access to your smart phone for a meditation app). When I do this I set a timer for 10 minutes on my phone. I&#039;ll take five deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth) and then close my eyes on the last breath out. Begin to breathe normally. I&#039;ll then focus on my breaths, counting to ten, and then start back at one. Side note: It&#039;s okay to lose focus! And tell yourself that when you realize you&#039;re not counting breaths anymore. &quot;Oh, my mind went off track and that&#039;s okay. I&#039;m going to focus on my breaths again&quot; and resume counting. I&#039;ve been meditating for six months now and still get sidetracked frequently.\r\n\r\n-Simple breathing. Whenever I feel the anxiety/nervousness/worry/etc. increasing, I&#039;ll go to the bathroom or another private place where I can sit in silence and count my breaths. This works as a good checkpoint through out the day, as I can try to &quot;refocus&quot; my mind.\r\n\r\n3) Therapy\r\n\r\n-Yay therapy! I&rsquo;ve been in therapy for the past 13 years. It has literally saved my life countless times. Therapy is beneficial for EVERYONE, especially those of us who suffer from anxiety.\r\n\r\n-I know some people have a hard time fitting therapy into their schedules or due to financial reasons (right there with you). A quick google search of &quot;best online counseling services&quot; ought to do the trick.\r\n\r\n-Not sure how it is in other countries but in America most colleges (and probably some high schools) provide free counseling services. These are real counselors and legally cannot contact your teachers, peers, or employers. Also, if you are nervous about your peers seeing you at the counseling center, think about that for a second. You are seeing them at the counseling center. Chances are they are also there for counseling. This can create an immediate and intimate bond between you guys, and maybe even someone to talk to about what&#039;s going on in your head.\r\n\r\n-For those afraid or who get anxiety about going to a counselor/therapist: Therapists are genuinely caring people. Most of them became therapists because they themselves have struggled with some sort of mental illness and/or a traumatic event. And they are legally required to maintain the integrity of your conversations, meaning they won&rsquo;t talk to people in your life or others about what you say. Everything you say is confidential. (That is unless you talk about harming yourself or others). I cannot stress how wonderful it feels to have someone in your life whose sole purpose is to listen to you vent about your feelings. One of our basic needs as humans is to feel heard. When we get that need met, we feel acknowledged and loved. This can mean all the world when it feels like no one in your life listens and/or understands the intensity of your anxiety.\r\n\r\n4) Journaling\r\n\r\n-Bring that pen to paper and vomit out all of your fears, angers, frustrations, sorrows, etc. Sometimes our anxiety gets stuck, and when we give it an outlet, it can make all the difference.\r\n\r\n-Writing virtually is good but I&rsquo;ve found that the act of physically writing out my emotions is so meaningful, and I feel a higher connection with my mental and emotional body.\r\n\r\n-In a previous thread I posted this information in, some people mentioned they didn&rsquo;t like reading their emotions because it made them feel guilty, angry, etc. It is okay to feel these emotions! BURN THE PAPER. Seriously. Burn. That. Shit. Up. Tear it up. Watch it go through a shredder. This is therapeutic! Feel like I have to say this&mdash;make sure if you do decide to go the burn route that you do it outside in a receptacle that can handle the heat!\r\n\r\n5) Podcasts\r\n\r\n-There are a number of very helpful anxiety podcasts. I&#039;d recommend The Anxiety Coach&#039;s Podcast. There are two new episodes each week (Wednesdays and Sundays) that somehow relate to anxiety. The host provides listeners with MANY tools for helping with anxiety, as well as an extremely diverse range of topics. I&#039;ve found that even episodes I don&#039;t think apply to my anxiety have always consisted of useful information and helpful tricks.\r\n\r\n-Other good podcasts include Anxiety Slayer, Anxiety Guru, The Anxiety Podcast, and The Anxiety Guy. Just like the meditation apps, give them all a try! If you don&rsquo;t like one you&rsquo;ll probably like another one more\r\n\r\n6) Exercise\r\n\r\n-GO OUTSIDE. Studies have proven time and time again that even just sitting in nature and hearing the sounds it has to offer lower cortisol levels (stress hormone)\r\n\r\n-Yoga. Any type is beneficial! I&#039;ve found the most anxiety relief from Restorative Yoga. The whole class consists of three poses (they aren&#039;t super complex yogi stances, usually lying on your back in a certain way)\r\n\r\n-Cardio is great for &quot;happy&quot; hormone production.\r\n\r\n-It&#039;s important to note which types of exercise make YOU feel good, as it&#039;s not the same for everyone. For example, running is great for you but if it&#039;s physically hurting your knees, ankles, etc. it&#039;s probably not the best for you. There&#039;s always a different form of exercise, and fortunately all types of exercise result in decreased anxiety! Any type of movement is better than no movement when it comes to anxiety :)\r\n\r\n7) Medication\r\n\r\n-Anxiety can be fucking torture. There is nothing worse than feeling like a prisoner to your own mind. Medication can definitely help soften this, especially if you are feeling like you can no longer go on.\r\n\r\n-Research your options. Talk to people you know who are taking something about what they like/don&rsquo;t like about being medicated. Read reviews. Read side effects (this might not be helpful if you are extremely prone to the placebo effect or have health anxiety).\r\n\r\n-READ ABOUT WITHDRAWAL. Once again, I am all for medication if you feel it is right for you. When I decided to go on Lexapro, I was 100% sure I wanted to. What I do regret is not researching withdrawal. Not only did I experience two weeks&rsquo; worth of physical symptoms (night sweats, racing heart) but also experienced severe depression and anxiety that was far worse than what I&rsquo;d experienced before going on it. I also have social anxiety now which I didn&rsquo;t have before. Anyways, the point of this is to research, research, research, and know your options!\r\n\r\n8) Random\r\n\r\n&quot;You Are the One&quot; by Kute Blackson is an inspirational read for anyone with anxiety\r\n-Posture makes a difference. Sitting up straight builds self-confidence and becomes easier with time\r\n\r\n-Write down quotes or phrases or mantras or whatever makes you feel good and hang them up in places where you&rsquo;ll see them frequently. Bathroom mirrors and inside front door are two really good places I utilize regularly. You can even write down reminders of why you&rsquo;re working on your anxiety.\r\n\r\n-PM me if you ever need someone to talk to! I&rsquo;m in the process of becoming a therapist myself so please please please contact me if you need to talk. I will not judge you and love to listen. Anxiety doesn&rsquo;t need to be a social taboo.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s important to note that working on your anxiety is a process. There&#039;s not one thing that is a magic cure-all. You&#039;ll have great days, weeks even, and then not-so-great days. It&#039;s crucial to remember that the down days don&#039;t last forever. And as a reminder, be extremely gentle with yourself. It is okay to feel other emotions besides happiness. This may sound weird but welcome them. Allow them to be. The more you resist them the harder and stronger they&rsquo;ll come back.\r\n\r\nOnce again, please feel free to PM me if you need to talk/vent. Best of luck to you on your journey and thanks for reading!', '2017-03-03 06:55:45', 0.59736276090053, 0, 0, 18, 1),

(56, 53, 'Stress is part of our life', 'Stress is anything that alters your natural balance. When stress is present, your body and your mind must attend to it in order to return you to balance. Your body reacts to stress by releasing hormones that help you cope with the situation.  That in turn takes energy away from the other functions of your brain, like concentrating, or taking action.  There are two different sources of stress: external triggers, like getting a poor grade or breaking up with your girlfriend/boyfriend, and internal triggers, like placing high expectations on yourself. \r\nStress is a part of everyday life. There are many instances when stress can be helpful. A fire alarm is intended to cause the stress that alerts you to avoid danger. The stress created by a deadline to finish a paper can motivate you to finish the assignment on time. But when experienced in excess, stress has the opposite effect. It can harm our emotional and physical health, and limit our ability to function at home, in school, and within our relationships. But the good news is that, since we are responsible for bringing about much of our own stress, we can also do much to manage stress by learning and practicing specific stress-reduction strategies.', '2017-03-03 06:55:45', 0.68157328721632, 0, 0, 12, 1),
(57, 53, 'Ways of reducing and managing stress', 'A feeling of control and a healthy balance in your schedule is a necessary part of managing stress. Learning how to manage your responsibilities, accomplish your goals and still have time for rest and relaxation requires that you practice time management skills.\r\nTry setting a specific goal for yourself that will improve your mood and help you reduce stress. Start by filling out a goal-setting worksheet.\r\nAvoid procrastination. Putting off assignments or responsibilities until the last minute can create more mental and physical stress than staying on top of them.  Procrastination can affect many aspects of daily life, such as the quality of your work, the quality of your sleep, and your mood.   \r\nExercise regularly. Physical activity can help you burn off the energy generated by stress.\r\nPractice good sleep habits to ensure that you are well-rested. Sleep deprivation can cause many physical and mental problems and can increase stress.\r\nTry mindfulness meditation. Attend this workshop to learn a variety of ways to work more skillfully with the stress and anxiety related to college life.\r\nLimit (or eliminate) the use of stimulants like caffeine, which can elevate the stress response in your body.\r\nPace yourself throughout the day, taking regular breaks from work or other structured activities. During breaks from class, studying, or work, spend time walking outdoors, listen to music or just sit quietly, to clear and calm your mind.\r\nStart a journal. Many people find journaling to be helpful for managing stress, understanding emotions, and making decisions and changes in their lives.\r\nRealize that we all have limits. Learn to work within your limits and set realistic expectations for yourself and others.\r\nRecognize the role your own thoughts can play in causing you distress. Challenge beliefs you may hold about yourself and your situation that may not be accurate. For example, do you continuously fall short of what you think you &ldquo;should&rdquo; accomplish? When our minds continuously feed us messages about what we &ldquo;should&rdquo; achieve, &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to be, or &ldquo;mustn&#039;t&rdquo; do, we are setting ourselves up to fall short of goals that may be unrealistic, and to experience stress along the way. Learn techniques for replacing unrealistic thoughts with more realistic ones.\r\nFind humor in your life. Laughter can be a great tension-reducer.\r\nSeek the support of friends and family when you need to &ldquo;vent&rdquo; about situations that bring on stressful feelings. But make sure that you don&rsquo;t focus exclusively on negative experiences; try to also think of at least three things that are going well for you, and share those experiences.\r\nTry setting a specific goal for yourself that will improve your mood and help you reduce stress.', '2017-03-03 06:55:45', 0.68157328721632, 0, 0, 12, 1),
